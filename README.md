# ds-opt-python
Python version of the [ds-opt](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt) package to generate, learn and execute dynamical system motion generators with the LPV-DS formulation.


Currently this is only an interface between Python and MATLAB, hence, [ds-opt](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/ds-opt) (and all of its dependencies) must be in your MATLAB path. Next steps are to implement the GMM-sampler and SDP optimization in python.
